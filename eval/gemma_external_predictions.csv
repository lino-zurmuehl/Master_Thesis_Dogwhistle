And then every year after that it got worse and worse and bogged down in more grind to potentially encourage buying something. Eventually, I was sitting through horribly written cutscenes where they often plug product, having to walk through a community hub instead of menus because they can cram in more ads and showcase the gear other people bought for their players better and having to grind more to get to a level that really feels good in the game. Went from lifelong fan to every other year to only if I'm given it through like Epic for free. It really sucks that there is no viable competitor providing a simulation level NBA game but alas.",0,0,7.031184213701636e-05
"In South America you‚Äôll find native some of the most unique species in the world like Anteaters, Sloths, Capybaras, Llamas, Toucans, etc. Well in North America the wildlife largely seems to be variants of species also found in Eurasia, why is this?",0,0,0.06255972385406494
"As the plane accelerates, we feel like we‚Äôre being pushed back into our seat. The same force must be applied to the air in the cabin. Is this correct? If so, how big of a difference in air pressure are we talking about here?EDIT: typo",0,0,0.0009399440023116767
"Depending on the type of bomb, weapon safety ranges from the practically impossible to have external damage intiate the device to at one time ludicrously likely. For more on the subject, look up ""One Point Safety"", and the circumstances which made it necessary.Nowadays, it shouldn't do much to have one nuclear device detonate next to another, although I guess it'd be (unlikely, but...) possible to have neutrons from the activated device cause some secondary fission in the second. Sort of like how if you have a fissionable material as the case of a weapon. But they'd literally have to be touching each other and it'd be nothing like the yield you'd get from detonating them both themselves independently.",0,0,5.263340430161634e-09

"I just don't like it anymore. I lived in Wisconsin from birth to age 30 and embraced the drinking culture there. I moved to Virginia where it's definitely not the same, but I still went to wineries and breweries and whatnot. Then right at the start of COVID I had a baby. Not drinking for the whole pregnancy and then not having the social opportunities really impacted me. I tried to get back to it but wine gives me horrible headaches now, I don't really like any of the beer I used to, and ciders give me heartburn. It's just not worth it anymore.",0,0,1.370957193103095e-06
"The main technical difficulty in producing a nuclear bomb is that the timing of implosion detonation, to get a critical mass compacted, is exquisite. A millisecond off and you basically just get a dud. Maybe what would essentially amount to a very small dirty bomb. In fact the timing mechanism is the main technology that's traditionally considered a state secret. Because without that enriched uranium is relatively useless as a bomb.It's hard for me to imagine that a lateral impact force, even from another nuclear bomb, would sufficiently compact the critical mass to be a major concern. Unless the geometry and orientation was explicitly chosen for that purpose.",0,0,1.0677028967620572e-06
